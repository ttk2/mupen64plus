Glide settings must be tweaked (but give the best results when done) Letters' texture distorted in Rice. Dynarec has random crashes. The treasure room crashes in the Maya world. A few caves crash in the dinosaur world. The bubble with reflections that leads to the cloud world gives a hard time to all video plugins. The game can be finished, though a few areas cannot be visited and a couple moves cannot be learned. (SVN [r1416](https://code.google.com/p/mupen64plus/source/detail?r=1416)+ only; version 1.5 has a blocker bug) |

|<font color='green'> =) </font> | Conker's Bad Fur Day          | Glide with _get frame buffer info_ off              | Collision detection issues (and more, including some blockers, with Rice). Major artefacts with glN64; Minor artifacts and missing lights with Rice. Glide doesn't seem to handle the game's dynamic shadows so better turn that option off.(mupen 1.5) |
|<font color='red'> =( </font>   | Donkey Kong 64                |                     |  can't get past intro (1.4, 1.5)   |

|<font color='orange'> =) </font>| Extreme-G 2                   |                     |   runs just fine (with some hiccups) with Glide video plugin. Incomplete/missing menu textures in Rice, Glide defaults make the game menus look more rough, make name input difficult, upon race completion the transition between victory scene and game message is not seamless. Victory scene looks odd. On occasion the top of the "Disc" at the bike selection screen will flash and show a different color underneath. Corners of the pictures on the track selection screen are visible, instead of being hidden.   |
|<font color='green'> =) </font> | F-Zero X                      |                     | Glide defaults have a visible seam in the middle of the track. |

|<font color='red'> =( </font>   | Hydro Thunder                 |                     | Game is unplayable no matter what settings are, but menus work just fine.  |
|<font color='green'> =) </font> | Iggy's Reckin' Balls          | RiceVideo, Expansion Pack Disabled  | Expansion Pack hangs at certain part of game |
|<font color='orange'> =) </font>| Jet Force Gemini              | Glide with : hi-res frame buffer on; get frame buffer info off; detect CPU writes on       | The bug doors don't turn green when the enemies die; the crosshair for the tri rocket and guided missile launcher don't show; Vela's boss has problems (unplayably laggish with Glide, blurry screen with Rice).  |
|<font color='green'> =) </font> | Kirby 64                      | Glide64             | The borders of the screen have random flashing garbage, and there are some distorted characters (for example, King De-De-De face). |
|<font color='green'> =) </font> | Mario Kart 64                 |                     |                  |

|<font color='green'> =) </font> | Puyo Puyo 4: Party            | RiceVideo (minor artifacts), Glide64 (disable compiled jump) | requires lots of CPU power. glN64: UCode is not detected, selecting the proper UCode results in a freeze. Glide64: Crashes after intro video (before entry into menu) |
|<font color='orange'> =) </font>| Rayman 2 - The great escape   | Glide64             | Some collision problems (vital characters/items going through wall/floor), can be worked around by saving and trying repeatedly and/or changing view angle (mupen 1.5) |
|<font color='green'> =) </font> | Rush 2                        | Glide64             | Artifacts with RiceVideo and glN64 |

|<font color='green'> =)  </font>| Zelda - Ocarina of Time       | RiceVideo, Glide       | Rice has the nice ability to play with HD textures if you have a pack, but Glide handles the lens of truth better. Rice may also sometimes have fog issues |
|<font color='orange'> =| </font>| Zelda - Majora's Mask         | Glide               | many cutscenes missing with Rice. Some cutscenes that don't work in Rice do work in Glide, but Glide is a little more prone to crashing. The game sometimes crashes, especially when going from day to night or vice-versa. |


## Detailed info about issues in some games ##


**Mario Kart 64**
> CRC: 3e5055b6 2e92da52
> MD5: 7D54D888964A3B0D058EB80886C44C88

> | _ver:_ mupen64plus-1.3-RC1-bin-64 | _plugins:_ rice-1.2-dev |
|:----------------------------------|:------------------------|
  * In high resolutions (tested with 1600x1200) and only in fullscreen mode the whole screen flashes + overdrawing artefacts. Sometimes there is a small centered picture-in-picture of the game, so the game runs as a small picture in the middle of the screen and the rest of the screen just flashes.
  * After every race the screen is split into 4 parts, where 2 of them shows the scores. The background color should here be black, but instead it's white most of the time and randomly flashes to black. Depending on the map there are other colors too.

**Mario Party**
> CRC: 2829657e a0621877
> MD5: 8BC2712139FBF0C56C8EA835802C52DC

> | _ver:_ mupen64-amd64-1.2-bin-64  | _plugins:_ glN64 + Jttl |
|:---------------------------------|:------------------------|
  * After a (complete) game is finished, the sound starts to stutter extremly loud. It's like there is garbage data in die audio buffer and played over and over again. You have to restart the game to get it back to normal.

> | _ver:_ mupen64plus-1.3-RC1-bin-64 | _plugins:_ glN64-0.4.1 |
|:----------------------------------|:-----------------------|
  * runs slower as with previous version (mupen64-amd64-1.2-bin-64 + glN64)
  * artifacts in mini games
  * sometimes characters and objects are flashing.
  * sometimes characters and objects are rendered multiple times. It's like the next motion frame gets drawn without erasing the previous one from the background. e.g. if a character moves from left to right you get a line of this character in different stages (overdrawing?).
  * while the screen is split up into 2 frames the second (either the right or the lower one) frame flashes.

> | _ver:_ mupen64plus-1.3-RC1-bin-64 | _plugins:_ rice-1.2-dev |
|:----------------------------------|:------------------------|
  * artefacts in mini games
  * sometimes characters and objects are invisible

**Mario Tennis**
> CRC: 839f3ad5 406d15fa
> MD5: FFF9B3E22ABB9B60215DAFB13AD5A4DE




> | _ver:_ mupen64plus-1.3-RC1-bin-64 | _plugins:_ rice-1.2-dev |
|:----------------------------------|:------------------------|
  * The emulator crashes...
  * at the end of the intro (but you can skip the intro).
  * when you've started a game and hit the ball the first time.

> | _ver_: mupen64plus-1.3-RC1-bin-64 | _pluigns:_ glN64-0.4.1 |
|:----------------------------------|:-----------------------|
  * Countless clipping artefacts.
  * Many black boxes around objects (render to texture not working?)
  * The replays are almost completly black, but skipable.

**MISCHIEF MAKERS**
> CRC: 418bda98 248a0f58
> MD5: EB3B078A74D4DC827E1E79791004DFBB

> | _ver:_ mupen64plus-1.3-RC1-bin-64 | _plugins:_ rice-1.2-dev AND glN64-0.4.1 |
|:----------------------------------|:----------------------------------------|
  * In Level 4-1 Astair's Lair you have to run away from a rolling stone. The sad thing is that's invisible. There are most likely more objects in the game which are invisible because of this bug but I only noticed this one so far.
  * The questions in the mathfun event in 3-10 are black and not possible to see.
  * In world 4, the screen is supposed to be dark, with only the center having a circle of light visible. This was done to simulate a dark cave with a flashlight shining on Marina. So far no plugin renders this correctly. Either the dark and light are swapped, or the screen is all light and no dark, but the correct "flashlight affect" is not present.
  * The message "two events of type 8 in queue" appears countless times in the console
  * Game lags (on stages 2-3, 2-8, the dash events in 3-10, and the hurdle event in 3-10, during some on screen explosions in worlds 3 and 5)
  * There are some outline issues, like in the intro, and in world 4 some plugins render a blue outline in the background.
  * in world 2, many of the textures of the grayish brown walls are completely off. gln64 1.1.1 renders these textures 100% accurate.

**Yoshi's Story**
> CRC: 3612688085 16777216
> MD5: D3436319D51DF291BA71A2E512DDB7B5

|:---------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------|
  * The Nintendo sprite at the beginning does not show up with Rice's Video or Glide64
  * The selection screens do not show up properly in Rice Video (White boxes over some sprites) or Glide64 (full screen is a varying shade of purple)
  * Rice Video: Many sprites in-game show up white.
  * glN64: No background objects are drawn in-game, causing the game to redraw over itself each frame
  * glide64: Crashes before entering gameplay.
